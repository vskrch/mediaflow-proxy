MediaFlow Proxy is a powerful and flexible solution for proxifying various types of media streams. It supports HTTP(S) links, HLS (M3U8) streams, and MPEG-DASH streams, including DRM-protected content. This proxy can convert MPEG-DASH DRM-protected streams to decrypted HLS live streams in real-time, making it one of the fastest live decrypter servers available.

## Features

### Stream Processing
- Convert MPEG-DASH streams (DRM-protected and non-protected) to HLS
- Support for Clear Key DRM-protected MPD DASH streams
- Support for non-DRM protected DASH live and VOD streams
- Proxy and modify HLS (M3U8) streams in real-time
- Proxy HTTP/HTTPS links with custom headers

### Proxy & Routing
- Advanced proxy routing system with support for:
  - Domain-based routing rules
  - Protocol-specific routing (HTTP/HTTPS)
  - Subdomain and wildcard patterns
  - Port-specific routing
- Support for HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy forwarding
- Flexible SSL verification control per route
- Support for expired or self-signed SSL certificates
- Public IP address retrieval for Debrid services integration

### Security
- API password protection against unauthorized access & Network bandwidth abuse prevention
- Parameter encryption to hide sensitive information
- Optional IP-based access control for encrypted URLs
- URL expiration support for encrypted URLs

### Additional Features
- Built-in speed test for RealDebrid and AllDebrid services
- Custom header injection and modification
- Real-time HLS manifest manipulation
- HLS Key URL modifications for bypassing stream restrictions


## Configuration

The proxy reads its configuration from environment variables. The most common
options are summarized below.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_PASSWORD` | _(none)_ | Protects against unauthorized access and API network abuses. |
| `ENABLE_STREAMING_PROGRESS` | `false` | Enable streaming progress logging. |
| `DISABLE_HOME_PAGE` | `false` | Disable the home page UI (returns 404 for `/` and `/index.html`). |
| `DISABLE_DOCS` | `false` | Disable the API documentation (`/docs`). |
| `DISABLE_SPEEDTEST` | `false` | Disable the speedtest UI (`/speedtest`). |
| `STREMIO_PROXY_URL` | _(none)_ | Stremio server URL for alternative content proxying. |
| `M3U8_CONTENT_ROUTING` | `mediaflow` | Routing strategy for M3U8 content URLs (`mediaflow`, `stremio`, or `direct`). |

### Transport Configuration

MediaFlow Proxy now supports advanced transport configuration using HTTPX's routing system. You can configure proxy and SSL verification settings for different domains and protocols.

#### Basic Configuration

Enable proxy for all routes:
```env
PROXY_URL=http://proxy:8080
ALL_PROXY=true
```

#### Advanced Routing Configuration

Configure different proxy settings for specific patterns:
```env
PROXY_URL=http://proxy:8080
TRANSPORT_ROUTES='{
    "https://internal.company.com": {
        "proxy": false
    },
    "all://streaming.service.com": {
        "proxy_url": "socks5://streaming-proxy:1080",
        "verify_ssl": false
    }
}'
```

The routing system supports various patterns:
- Domain routing: `"all://example.com"`
- Subdomain routing: `"all://*.example.com"`
- Protocol-specific routing: `"https://example.com"`
- Port-specific routing: `"all://*:1234"`
- Wildcard routing: `"all://"`

#### Route Configuration Options

Each route can have the following settings:
- `proxy`: Boolean to enable/disable proxy for this route (default: true)
- `proxy_url`: Optional specific proxy URL for this route (overrides primary proxy_url)
- `verify_ssl`: Boolean to control SSL verification (default: true)

#### Configuration Examples

1. Simple proxy setup with SSL bypass for internal domain:
    ```env
    PROXY_URL=http://main-proxy:8080
    TRANSPORT_ROUTES='{
        "https://internal.domain.com": {
            "proxy": false,
            "verify_ssl": false
        }
    }'
    ```

2. Different proxies for different services:
    ```env
    PROXY_URL=http://default-proxy:8080
    TRANSPORT_ROUTES='{
        "all://*.streaming.com": {
            "proxy": true,
            "proxy_url": "socks5://streaming-proxy:1080"
        },
        "all://*.internal.com": {
            "proxy": false
        },
        "https://api.service.com": {
            "proxy": true,
            "verify_ssl": false
        }
    }'
    ```

3. Global proxy with exceptions:
    ```env
    PROXY_URL=http://main-proxy:8080
    ALL_PROXY=true
    TRANSPORT_ROUTES='{
        "all://local.network": {
            "proxy": false
        },
        "all://*.trusted-service.com": {
            "proxy": false
        }
    }'
    ```

### Cache Settings

Initialization segments, MPDs and extractor results are cached in the system's
temporary directory. If you need to change the location, set the `TMPDIR`
environment variable before starting the server:

```bash
TMPDIR=/path/to/cache mediaflow-proxy
```

Cached items are automatically purged based on their TTL (1 hour for init
segments and speed test data, 5 minutes for extractor results).

### Speed Test Feature

MediaFlow Proxy now includes a built-in speed test feature for testing RealDebrid and AllDebrid network speeds. To access the speed test:

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server:8888/speedtest.html`
2. The speed test page allows you to:
   - Test download speeds from RealDebrid servers
   - Test download speeds from AllDebrid servers

### Examples

#### Proxy HTTPS Stream

```bash
mpv "http://localhost:8888/proxy/stream?d=https://jsoncompare.org/LearningContainer/SampleFiles/Video/MP4/sample-mp4-file.mp4&api_password=your_password"
```

#### Proxy HTTPS self-signed certificate Stream

To bypass SSL verification for a self-signed certificate stream, export the proxy route configuration:
```bash
PROXY_ROUTES='{"https://self-signed.badssl.com": {"proxy_url": null, "verify_ssl": false}}'
```

```bash
mpv "http://localhost:8888/proxy/stream?d=https://self-signed.badssl.com/&api_password=your_password"
```


#### Proxy HLS Stream with Headers

```bash
mpv "http://localhost:8888/proxy/hls/manifest.m3u8?d=https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/img_bipbop_adv_example_fmp4/master.m3u8&h_referer=https://apple.com/&h_origin=https://apple.com&h_user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/118.0.0.0 Safari/537.36&api_password=your_password"
```

#### Proxy M3U/M3U_Plus IPTV Streams with Forced Playlist Proxying

For IPTV m3u/m3u_plus streams where playlist URLs don't have clear keyword indicators, use the `force_playlist_proxy` parameter. This is commonly used with IPTV clients and applications:

```bash
# Example IPTV stream URL for use in IPTV clients like TiviMate, IPTV Smarters, etc.
http://localhost:8888/proxy/hls/manifest.m3u8?d=https://iptv.example.com/playlist.m3u&force_playlist_proxy=true&api_password=your_password

# With custom headers for IPTV providers that require authentication
http://localhost:8888/proxy/hls/manifest.m3u8?d=https://iptv.provider.com/stream&force_playlist_proxy=true&h_user-agent=IPTV-Client&h_referer=https://iptv.provider.com&api_password=your_password
```

**IPTV Use Cases:**
- **M3U Playlists**: When IPTV providers use m3u format without clear file extensions
- **M3U_Plus Playlists**: Extended m3u format with additional metadata
- **Provider-Specific Streams**: IPTV services with custom playlist formats
- **Authentication Required**: Streams that need specific headers or authentication

#### Live DASH Stream (Non-DRM Protected)

```bash
mpv -v "http://localhost:8888/proxy/mpd/manifest.m3u8?d=https://livesim.dashif.org/livesim/chunkdur_1/ato_7/testpic4_8s/Manifest.mpd&api_password=your_password"
```

#### VOD DASH Stream (DRM Protected)

```bash
mpv -v "http://localhost:8888/proxy/mpd/manifest.m3u8?d=https://media.axprod.net/TestVectors/v7-MultiDRM-SingleKey/Manifest_1080p_ClearKey.mpd&key_id=nrQFDeRLSAKTLifXUIPiZg&key=FmY0xnWCPCNaSpRG-tUuTQ&api_password=your_password"
```

Note: The `key` and `key_id` parameters are automatically processed if they're not in the correct format.

### URL Encoding

For players like VLC that require properly encoded URLs, use the `encode_mediaflow_proxy_url` function:

```python
from mediaflow_proxy.utils.http_utils import encode_mediaflow_proxy_url

encoded_url = encode_mediaflow_proxy_url(
    mediaflow_proxy_url="http://127.0.0.1:8888",
    endpoint="/proxy/mpd/manifest.m3u8",
    destination_url="https://media.axprod.net/TestVectors/v7-MultiDRM-SingleKey/Manifest_1080p_ClearKey.mpd",
    query_params={
        "key_id": "nrQFDeRLSAKTLifXUIPiZg",
        "key": "FmY0xnWCPCNaSpRG-tUuTQ",
        "api_password": "your_password"
    },
    request_headers={
        "referer": "https://media.axprod.net/",
        "origin": "https://media.axprod.net",
    }
)

print(encoded_url)

# http://127.0.0.1:8888/proxy/mpd/manifest.m3u8?key_id=nrQFDeRLSAKTLifXUIPiZg&key=FmY0xnWCPCNaSpRG-tUuTQ&api_password=your_password&d=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.axprod.net%2FTestVectors%2Fv7-MultiDRM-SingleKey%2FManifest_1080p_ClearKey.mpd&h_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.axprod.net%2F&h_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.axprod.net
```

This will output a properly encoded URL that can be used with players like VLC.

```bash
vlc "http://127.0.0.1:8888/proxy/mpd/manifest.m3u8?key_id=nrQFDeRLSAKTLifXUIPiZg&key=FmY0xnWCPCNaSpRG-tUuTQ&api_password=dedsec&d=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.axprod.net%2FTestVectors%2Fv7-MultiDRM-SingleKey%2FManifest_1080p_ClearKey.mpd"
```

### Generating URLs

MediaFlow Proxy provides endpoints to generate properly encoded or encrypted URLs for use with media players.
- `/generate_url`: Generate a single encoded or encrypted URL
- `/generate_urls`: Generate multiple URLs with shared common parameters


#### Single URL Generation

To generate a single encoded or encrypted URL:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8888/generate_url"
data = {
    "mediaflow_proxy_url": "http://localhost:8888",
    "endpoint": "/proxy/stream",
    "destination_url": "https://example.com/video.mp4",
    "query_params": {
        "some_param": "value"
        # Add "api_password" here for encoded (non-encrypted) URLs
        # "api_password": "your_password"
    },
    "request_headers": {
        "referer": "https://example.com/",
        "origin": "https://example.com",
    },
    "expiration": 3600,  # URL will expire in 1 hour (only for encrypted URLs)
    "ip": "123.123.123.123",  # Optional: Restrict access to this IP (only for encrypted URLs)
    "api_password": "your_password",  # Add here for encrypted URLs
    "filename": "movie.mp4"  # Optional: Preserve filename for media players (only for /proxy/stream endpoint)
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
encoded_url = response.json()["url"]
print(encoded_url)
```

> **Important Notes:**
> - If you add `api_password` at the root level of the request, the URL will be **encrypted**.
> - If you add `api_password` inside the `query_params` object, the URL will only be **encoded** (not encrypted).
> - The `filename` parameter is optional and should only be used with the `/proxy/stream` endpoint, not with MPD or HLS proxy endpoints.
> - The legacy endpoint `/generate_encrypted_or_encoded_url` is still available but deprecated. It's recommended to use `/generate_url` instead.

#### Multiple URLs Generation

To generate multiple URLs with shared common parameters:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8888/generate_urls"
data = {
    "mediaflow_proxy_url": "http://localhost:8888",
    "api_password": "your_password",
    "expiration": 3600,  # URLs will expire in 1 hour (only for encrypted URLs)
    "ip": "123.123.123.123",  # Optional: Restrict access to this IP (only for encrypted URLs)
    "urls": [
        {
            "destination_url": "https://example.com/video1.mp4",
            "request_headers": {"referer": "https://example.com"},
            "filename": "movie1.mp4",
            "endpoint": "/proxy/stream"
        },
        {
            "destination_url": "https://example.com/video2.mp4",
            "request_headers": {"referer": "https://example.com"},
            "filename": "movie2.mp4",
            "endpoint": "/proxy/stream"
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
encoded_urls = response.json()["urls"]
for url in encoded_urls:
    print(url)
```

#### Filename Preservation for Media Players

MediaFlow Proxy now supports preserving filenames in URLs, which is particularly useful for media players like Infuse that use the filename to fetch metadata. When you include a `filename` parameter in your request, the proxy will ensure this information is preserved and properly passed to the media player.

This feature helps media players display the correct title and fetch appropriate metadata instead of showing generic names like "Stream".

### Using MediaFlow Proxy with Debrid Services and Stremio Addons

MediaFlow Proxy can be particularly useful when working with Debrid services (like Real-Debrid, AllDebrid) and Stremio addons. The `/proxy/ip` endpoint allows you to retrieve the public IP address of the MediaFlow Proxy server, which is crucial for routing Debrid streams correctly.

When a Stremio addon needs to create a video URL for a Debrid service, it typically needs to provide the user's public IP address. However, when routing the Debrid stream through MediaFlow Proxy, you should use the IP address of the MediaFlow Proxy server instead.

Here's how to utilize MediaFlow Proxy in this scenario:

1. If MediaFlow Proxy is accessible over the internet:
   - Use the `/proxy/ip` endpoint to get the MediaFlow Proxy server's public IP.
   - Use this IP when creating Debrid service URLs in your Stremio addon.

2. If MediaFlow Proxy is set up locally:
   - Stremio addons can directly use the client's IP address.

### Using Stremio Server for M3U8 Content Proxy

MediaFlow Proxy supports routing video segments through Stremio server for better performance while keeping playlists through MediaFlow for access control.

#### Configuration

```bash
# Set Stremio server URL
STREMIO_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11470

# Choose routing strategy
M3U8_CONTENT_ROUTING=stremio  # or "mediaflow" (default) or "direct"
```

**Routing Options:**
- `mediaflow` (default): All content through MediaFlow
- `stremio`: Video segments through Stremio, playlists through MediaFlow
- `direct`: Video segments served directly, playlists through MediaFlow

**Force Playlist Proxy Parameter:**

For IPTV streams where the playlist format (m3u/m3u_plus) cannot be reliably detected from the URL, you can use the `force_playlist_proxy` parameter to ensure all playlist URLs are proxied through MediaFlow:

```bash
# Force all playlist URLs to be proxied through MediaFlow (for IPTV clients)
http://localhost:8888/proxy/hls/manifest.m3u8?d=https://iptv.provider.com/playlist&force_playlist_proxy=true&api_password=your_password
```

This parameter bypasses URL-based detection and routing strategy, ensuring consistent behavior for IPTV streams that don't have clear format indicators in their URLs.

### CLI Commands

Run the server:

```bash
mediaflow-proxy
```

Decrypt an MP4 segment from the command line:

```bash
python -m mediaflow_proxy.drm.decrypter --init init.mp4 --segment seg.m4s \
    --key_id 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef --key abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789 \
    --output decrypted.mp4
```
